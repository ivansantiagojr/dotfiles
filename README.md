# My dotfiles
Mainly bash, neovim and tmux.

## Some notes from when I started learning vim. Sometimes, they are still useful:)
Since I'm learning more about Vim, I decided to share the configs I have been using.

Here's a list of useful Vim commands:

On normal mode (press ESC to enter normal mode):

- :q - to quit Vim
- :q! - quit without saving
- :e newfile - opens new file for editing 
- :w - to save changes
- :wq - to save and quit
- :s/old/new/g - to substitute a word
- %s/old/new/g - to substitute all old word occurrencies
- :set nu - to put number on the left side
- :syn on - to enable syntax highlight
- :colorscheme darkblue - to set the color scheme to darkblue (you can press tab after writing "colorscheme" to navigate through options)
- cw - change word
- u - undo last action
- y - copy selected text
- yy - copy current line
- p - paste copied text
- dd - cut the current line
- o - adds a line under the current line
- A - moves cursor to the end of line and enter in insert mode
- CTLR + a - Increments number under the cursor
- CTRL + x - decrements number under the cursor
- CTRL + ww - moves cursor to the next window

# Navigate
 - Arrow Keys
 - k - up
 - j - down
 - l - right
 - h - left
 - w - moves cursor one word forward
 - b - moves cursos one word back

In this navigation mode we can use, for example, 3k to go 3 rows up, it can be any number, and the same works with the other navigation keys.
